# 100 Days Of Code - logs

### Day 3: March 28, 2022

**Today's Progress:** MongoDB University: inserting new documents, inserting multiple documents using .insert(). E-commerce gallery: used Flexbox and styled nav bar.

**Thoughts:** Had some difficulty connecting to MongoDB - my fault. Had to figure out where I left off, refreshed, and reviewed some general commands.

### Day 2: March 27, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Added styled-components. Worked on navbar. Added Matarial-UI icons.

### Day 1: March 26, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Created a React app and repository. My intent is to migrate my E-commerce art gallery on Squarespace to a custom MERN app.

**Thoughts:** Second time doing 100 Days of Code. Since moving, I've picked up some bad habits I want to rectify. Been wanting to make a real store form scratch for over a year - finally decide to jump in.
