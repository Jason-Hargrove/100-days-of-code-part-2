# 100 Days Of Code - logs

### Day 1: March 26, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Created a React app and repository. My intent is to migrate my ecommerce art gallery on Squarespace to a custom MERN app.

**Thoughts:** Second time doing 100 Days of Code. Since moving, I've picked up some bad habits I want to rectify. Been wanting to make a real store form scratch for over a year - finally decide to jump in.
